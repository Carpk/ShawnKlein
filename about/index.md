Done a lot of stuff; worked as a carpenter, mechanic, electronics technician, and even an IT professional. It's made me more open and appreciative of other industries, such as: finance, agriculture, construction, and history. Whether it's selling pastries, aninteractive marketing display, or a custom financial analyzing tool, it's been my goal to use software to help businesses and people share the things they care about.

I sold all my stuff and took a one way trip to Chicago to attend DevBootcamp. Created some interesting things, attended a couple apprenticships, and eventually found myself to the doors of UIC where I graduated with bachelors of computer science. Currently looking into AWS certifications.
