Software has the ability to give it's user unlimited possiblities for potential. It can open opportunities that were unobtainable 20 years ago. Such as making it easy to learn a new language, picking up new cooking recipes, and starting a business. No matter where you are at in life, it gives the gift of potential.

I love all aspects of computing, from networking to writing code. I moved to Chicago on a one way trip to attend Dev Bootcamp, which is a 9 week crash course on web development. I have a CompTIA A+ certification, experienced in configuring Cisco enterprise routers, and an open source advocate.
