I've enjoy a lot of stuff: carpentry, working on old cars, electronics, cooking, IT stuff, growing vegtables, and even a little swing trading. It's important to be appreciative of other industries and aspects of life. It helps you understand what others are dealing with, what they need, and perhaps makes a little bit of a better developer. Whether it's selling pastries, an interactive marketing display, or a custom financial data analyzing tool, it's been my goal to use software to help businesses and people share the things they care about.

I came to Chicago in 2013 where I attended DevBootcamp. Created some interesting things, attended a couple apprenticeships, and recieved a  bachelors of computer science from UIC in 2023.
