Software has the unique ability to bestow it's user unlimited resources, allowing growth in all aspects of our lives. Such as making it easy to learn a new language, picking up new cooking recipes, and starting a business. No matter where you are in life, it gives the gift of perpetual growth.

I'm involved in all aspects of computing, from networking to writing code. I moved to Chicago in 13' to join the growing tech community. I have a CompTIA A+ certification, experienced in configuring Cisco enterprise routers, and have several years experience in IT.
