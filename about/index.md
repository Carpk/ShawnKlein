Software has the unique ability to give it's user unlimited resources, allowing growth on multiple platforms. It allows people opportunities that were unobtainable 20 years ago. Such as making it easy to learn a new language, picking up new cooking recipes, and starting a business. No matter where you are at in life, it gives the gift of potential.

I'm involved in all aspects of computing, from networking to writing code. I moved to Chicago in 13', to join the growing tech community. I have a CompTIA A+ certification, experienced in configuring Cisco enterprise routers, and an open source advocate.
