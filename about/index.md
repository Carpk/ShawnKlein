I've always been fascinated of the possibilities that software has to offer people, how it can open up opportunities for someone. Want to learn a new language? How bout a new cooking recipe? Start a business? Any and everything is possible with the beauty of the web.

I love all aspects of computing, from networking to writing code. I moved to Chicago on a one way trip to attend Dev Bootcamp, which is a 9 week crash course on web development. I have a CompTIA A+ certification, experienced in configuring Cisco enterprise routers, and knowledable in Linux environments.
