## ShawnKlein.net

This is my personal blog that I have been working on/off for the past couple years. It is generated using Jekyll, and currently hosted in an AWS bucket at [ShawnKlein.net](http://shawnklein.net). 

#### Requirements

After trying to revive this site, was able to get it running with:

Ruby 2.6.3, Python 2.7.18

#### Getting Started:

To build and run this file, you must have Jekyll installed:

````bash
~$ bundle
````

To run as a server:

````bash
~$ jekyll serve
````

To compile into static HTML site:

````bash
~$ jekyll build
````
