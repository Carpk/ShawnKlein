Representational State Transfer (REST) is the architectural style used in the development of Web services for the World Wide Web. RESTful systems typically use HTTP to request, retrieve, and send data to web servers. It was designed to be performant, scalable, simplistic, visible, portable, and reliable.

A HTTP request will typically look like:

`http://www.example.com/guests/shawn`



#### Client-Server

There is a separation of concerns where clients (such as your browser) are not concerned with data storage, and the servers are not concerned with the user interface. 

#### Stateless

State session is held in the client.

#### Cacheable

#### Uniformed Interface

#### Layered System

#### Code On Demand
