Duck typing is an object oriented design technique that lets us generalize the type of object we have in order to let us invoke methods that are common across a set of classes. To implement this technique, we need to be able to recognize the places in our code that our application would benefit from having similar interfaces. These are public interfaces, that are not unique to their respective class, and are common on an abstract level.

When using an object we should not be concerned about its class, what we want to look at is the public interface. We are looking to create an object that trusts all others to be what it expects at any given moment, and any of those objects can be any kind of thing. If an object quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, then its class is immaterial, itâ€™s a duck.

Duck typing happens when we bring our object's behaviors to a more abstract level. If we have a common behavior among our classes, they can share that public interface, and if need be, that interface can except `self` for which ever attributes it would need. In our example below, the `BodyShop` object doesn't care about the car's engine or upholstery, it only cares that the object being passed to itself has something body related that it can respond to. 

````ruby
class Car
  attr_reader :body, :engine, :upholstery, 
  def fix_with(type)
    type.repair(self)
  end
end

gto67.fix_with(BodyShop.new)
gto67.fix_with(GasMechanic.new)
gto67.fix_with(Upholstery.new)
````
The `Car` class doesn't know what type of object was passed in for `#fix_with()`'s argument, nor should it care. If the object has the behavior of `#repair()` and does it like a `GasMechanic` and does other `GasMachanic` things, then it must be a `GasMechanic`.

What helps direct us, is the fact that the `#fix_with()` method serves a single purpose. Its argument arrives wishing to accomplish a single goal. This is where the argument's class is less important than what the `#fix_with()` needs to do. Its goal is to fix something, and the design allows the passing object to do so.

We may already have ducks hidden somewhere in our codebase. Using some of the methods below may be an indication that we have duck types hidden in our code.

* `case` statements that switch on class
* `kind_of?` and `is_a?`
* `responds_to?`

Having `case` statements that switch on class is a sign of a hidden duck. `kind_of?` will directly ask if it is a specific class. `responds_to?` is better because it helps remove the hard coded class name, but we can still do a lot better.

````ruby
parts.each do |part|
  case part
  when Wheel
    part.polish_rim(wheels)
  when Window
    part.wipe_with_cleaner(windshield)
  when Body
    part.gently_wash(paneling)
  end
end

if part.kind_of?(Wheel)
  part.polish_rim(wheels)
elsif part.kind_of?(Window)
  ## omitting the rest ##

if part.responds_to?(:polish_rim)
  part.polish_rim(wheels)
elsif part.responds_to?(:wipe_with_cleaner)
  ## omitting the rest ##
````

In the top section of our example, we depend on a concrete class, which makes it dangerous to extend. These types of methods to find out who the object is an instance of to figure out what they do, breaks the type of trust for objects to collaborate on an abstract level. Its the interface that matters, not the class of the object that implements it. Flexible applications are built on objects that operate on trust; it is our job to make your objects trustworthy. This type of code also introduces dependencies that make code difficult to change.

All of these `part` objects share something in common, on a higher abstract level, they clean something.

````ruby
class Car
  def clean
    parts.each do |part|
      part.wash(self)
    end
  end
end
````

This makes it easy to extend, if we were ever to add an addtional class to our `parts` array, the only behavior we would need from it is for a `wash` public interface.
